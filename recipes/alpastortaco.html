    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Al pastor tacos are a beloved Mexican dish that blends indigenous flavors with Middle Eastern culinary influence. The dish traces its origins to Lebanese immigrants who introduced the concept of shawarma-style meat cooking to Mexico in the early 20th century. Traditionally, al pastor consists of marinated pork stacked onto a vertical spit, known as a trompo, and slow-roasted while continuously shaved off for serving. The marinade typically includes achiote paste, guajillo chilies, pineapple, vinegar, and a blend of spices, which infuse the meat with a balance of smoky, sweet, and tangy flavors. As the pork cooks, the outer layers become slightly charred and caramelized, adding depth to the taste and texture.

        Once cooked, the tender, flavorful meat is thinly sliced and served on warm corn tortillas, often topped with diced onions, fresh cilantro, and a slice of grilled or fresh pineapple for a burst of sweetness. Many enjoy their tacos with a squeeze of lime and a drizzle of salsa verde or roja for extra spice. Though traditionally cooked on a spit, al pastor can also be made at home using a grill, oven, or stovetop, preserving the signature flavor profile. This dish embodies the rich fusion of cultures that defines Mexican cuisine, making it a favorite at taco stands, restaurants, and home kitchens alike.
