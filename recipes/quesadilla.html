    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Quesadillas are a beloved Mexican dish consisting of a warm, toasted tortilla filled with melted cheese and often other ingredients such as meats, vegetables, or beans. Traditionally made with corn tortillas, flour tortillas are also a popular option, especially in northern Mexico and Tex-Mex cuisine. The name "quesadilla" comes from the Spanish word for cheese, "queso," highlighting the dish’s signature ingredient. The tortilla is folded over or stacked with fillings before being cooked on a griddle or skillet until golden brown and crispy on the outside. Quesadillas are versatile and can be served as a snack, appetizer, or main dish, often accompanied by salsa, guacamole, or sour cream for dipping.

        While cheese remains the core component, modern quesadillas can include a variety of fillings to suit different tastes. Popular additions include grilled chicken, steak, shrimp, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, or roasted peppers. Some variations also incorporate black beans, refried beans, or even fruits like mango for a sweet and savory twist. The cooking process ensures that the cheese becomes gooey and binds the ingredients together, creating a satisfying bite every time. Whether made simply with cheese or packed with flavorful fillings, quesadillas remain a comforting and easy-to-make favorite worldwide.
